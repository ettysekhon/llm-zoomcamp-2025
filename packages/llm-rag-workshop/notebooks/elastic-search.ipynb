Steps mentioned include:\\n   - If you're using `docker-compose`, you might want to use a different port mapping like changing from `5432:5432` to `5431:5432`.\\n\\n5. **Authentication Issues**: If the problem is related to password authentication, double-check the username and password you are using.
